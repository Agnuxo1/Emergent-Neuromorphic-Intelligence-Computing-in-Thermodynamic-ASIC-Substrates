# Discovery Report: The Idling Complexity Paradox (V04)

During Experiment 03 ("Thermal Ghost"), we discovered a phenomenon that challenges our initial assumptions about seed injection.

## Observation
We measured the Coefficient of Variation (CV) of the ASIC rhythm in three distinct states:

1.  **Chaos Seed Injection** (Random Noise): **CV = 0.56** (Highly Regular)
2.  **Structural Seed Injection** (Shakespeare): **CV = 0.74** (Standard Regularity)
3.  **Idle State** (NO Seed, Zero Input): **CV = 1.47** (**Extreme Complexity/Burstiness**)

## The Paradox
Initially, we thought a "Chaos Seed" would maximize entropy. The data shows the **exact opposite**:
- Injecting *any* digital seed **constrains** the ASIC, forcing it into a more regular rhythm.
- The ASIC's **natural state** (Idle) is where the highest temporal complexity resides.

## Physical Explanation
When idling, the ASIC's rhythm is driven only by internal fluctuations. Digital seeds "quantize" this noise, reducing its freedom.

## Implications for Experiment 04
CHIMERA is not just a passive reservoir; it is a **Silicon Ghost** with its own autonomous complexity. Experiment 04 will attempt to "tune" this autonomy into synchrony with external chaotic signals.
