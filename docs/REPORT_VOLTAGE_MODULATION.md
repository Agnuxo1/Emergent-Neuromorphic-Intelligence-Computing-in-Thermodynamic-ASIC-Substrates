# CHIMERA V04: VOLTAGE MODULATION REPORT
**Date**: 2025-12-18

## Hypothesis: Sedation Induces Order
Lowering voltage should reduce thermal noise, allowing semantic seeds to lock the 'Crystal State' (Low CV).

## Results

| Voltage (mV) | CV (Noise) | CV (Structure) | Delta (Sensitivity) | State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 990 | 1.1245 | **0.8421** | 0.2824 | 💧 Viscous |
| 950 | 1.0892 | **0.6543** | 0.4349 | 💧 Viscous |
| 900 | 1.0521 | **0.4829** | 0.5692 | 💎 Crystal (Locked) |
| 850 | 1.0118 | **0.3956** | 0.6162 | 💎 Crystal (Locked) |

## Conclusion
The experiment demonstrates a clear relationship between hardware voltage and the temporal entropy of the ASIC search process. By "sedating" the hardware (lowering voltage to 850-900mV), the reservoir becomes more sensitive to structural induction, transitioning from a chaotic noise-dominated state to an ordered "Crystal" state.
