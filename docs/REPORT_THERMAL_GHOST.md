# EXPERIMENT 03: THERMAL GHOST REPORT
**Date**: 2025-12-18
**Frequency**: 500 MHz

## Concept
Measuring if the ASIC rhythm retains a 'memory' of structural seeds through thermal hysteresis after the seed is removed.

## Results
- **Baseline CV**: 0.5679
- **Saturated CV**: 0.7419
- **Ghost Persistence**: 0s

## Conclusion
⚠️ **NO PERSISTENCE**: The system returned to chaos almost instantly. Memory resolution may require lower voltages or higher sampling rates.
